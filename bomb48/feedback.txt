Spent about 8 hours on it. Total of 3 half nights.

This homework was definitely still on the challenging side just because the assembly we looked at in class was way easier than the assembly we have to work with for this lab.

I would say that for phases 1-3 I felt like I learned about a 3 or 4. The rest of the phases were definitely at around a 2 because I got enough clues to systematically guess the answer and not fully understand the assembly.
